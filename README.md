**Fully End-to-End Autmoatic Speech Recognition from Raw Audio**

The aim of this project is to idenitfy and implement *fully* end-to-end Autmoatic Speech Recognition (ASRs) systems that operate on *raw* audio. A fully end-to-end ASR is one that operates on the raw audio input, instead of any extracted features (e.g., MFCCs). 

**How to use the code base**
The `scripts` folder contains example code that you use can change to build your own pipeline.

**Implemented Papers:**
