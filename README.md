**Fully End-to-End Autmoatic Speech Recognition from Raw Audio**
The aim of this project is to idenitfy and implement *fully* end-to-end Autmoatic Speech Recognition (ASRs) systems that operate on *raw* audio. A fully end-to-end ASR is one that operates on the raw audio input, instead of any extracted features (e.g., MFCCs).
